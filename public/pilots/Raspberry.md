## Bio

Not much is known of Ada Armada before joining MSMC. Notoriously cagey when talking about herself, she has a penchant for fabricating details of her history. What is known is her keen interest in AI, and her work promoting Mirrorsmoke (and herself, of course) via livestream and social media.

## Rumours

* Lies regularly about herself
* Bribed or otherwise cheated her way into a Lancer License
* Joined MSMC only for the clout
* Needs to stay away from her original homeland
* Is an AI/NHP specialist working on some classified project stolen from one of the big four
* Used to be in a cult
