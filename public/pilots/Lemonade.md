## Bio

Finx wandered through the dimly lit hangars of Mirrorsmoke's Dawnline HQ, passively scanning rows of decommissioned and scavenged units. A core-world recruit might have had their mech custom printed, but in the long rim, salvage was a way of life. Given the recency of her license, she would be limited to a GMS-Everest model. Hardly an inconvenience, the Everest was known galaxy-wide for its reliability and flexible systems, it would suit her just fine. She moved slowly, taking inventory of its many varieties and surveying the variety of forms it could take. One would speak to her, it would rush forward and call her name. It found her quickly: A hot-pink, amphibious, two-seater with plenty of room for additional systems. It was hideous. A twitchy holo-plate with wavering, neon letters: We Were Made for Each Other, flickered and reflected off nearby scrap. No one else would have given it a second glance. It would be stuck in the rust and dust forever. 

A couple's mobile honeymoon suite was now registered to Lemonade's MSMC license. Manuals were unearthed. Diagnostics were run. Systems were updated. Discontinued parts were replaced. Warranties were definitely voided. She spent a full day on the paint alone, restoring the hue and saturation of its prime. The historical value of each personalization was judged. Some, too scandalous for the battlefield, were discarded. Others were deemed essential.

The WWMEO (Wee-mee-oh) now battles with the cautious precision of a careful and hesitant pilot. Each movement calculated, avoiding anything showy or risky. Keeping it in perfect repair,  Finx attests it is finally getting the love it has always deserved.
