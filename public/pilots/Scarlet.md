## Bio

Rach Scarlet is a recent arrival to the local mercenary scene. A masked pilot who conceals his true identity and even his face seemingly at all times, those who have worked with him say he handles himself competently, albeit with a few unusual rookie mistakes here and there. Although he advertises himself as a mercenary pilot for hire, most jobs he has taken have been in or around Karrakis and other Barony worlds, and he is rumoured to offer significant discounts in return for information regarding Karrakin politics. 

A new hire for Mirrorsmoke, he provided shockingly little experience on his resume, but was able to pass all basic piloting aptitude tests with very high scores, barely earning himself a chance to prove he belongs in the group.

## Rumours

* He tested very high on the aptitude scores, but could not provide significant examples of practical fieldwork experience.
* He hates the Kaarakin Trade Baronies.
* He may have been part of a crew that recently attacked a small Barony Outpost, causing a minor Data Leak that cost Karakis some significant money to plug up.
* His mask is hiding a brutal scar.
* He’s a runaway prince, looking for rebellious adventure. Hence, the ridiculous outfit. 
* He’s a fugitive criminal murderer, trying to lay low with a new identity.
