## Bio

Grew up on some unspecified SSC constellar world along the Sierra Madre line. Was hand-selected by regional SSC execs to take a combat-effctiveness/mech pilot aptitude test. She continues to hold the test record to this day.

She left the SSC Constellar Security Force of her own accord and approached MSMC looking for work.
