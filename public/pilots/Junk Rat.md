##Bio 

Fink Bondo hails from the Long Rim. She lived and worked on the asteroid mining colony GEDDON-42V (near HA designated DS-10) as a miner, scrapper, and mechanic. Her sector has been coined 'The Ass End of Space' by the locals and the few travelers that pass by. It's a tough way to live, and while her skills kept her comfortable enough she's always wanted to see what was beyond the colony. Her mechanic skills, experience with heavy or broken down equipment in high stakes and dangerous unstable environments, and her, ah…passion for demolition makes her an attractive candidate to Mirrorsmoke
