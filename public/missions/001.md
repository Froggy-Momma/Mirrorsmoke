## About MSMC

A pan-galactic mercenary organization known for its
 low rates, broad portfolio, and civic legitimization
 service, the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company
 (MSMC) is formally incorporated as a “grayspace”
 private military company. No job is too big or too
 small, as long as a Union state in good standing will
 call it legal. Greyspace is an informal term, perfect for
 Mirrorsmoke’s preferences: the company’s legal
corps, in contrast with the private military branch, is
 considered a prestigious, cutthroat interstellar firm,
 specializing in orbital, terrestrial, and criminal law.
