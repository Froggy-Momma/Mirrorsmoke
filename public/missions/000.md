# Mission // #000
## A Routine Background Check
# Requirements
- Name or legal alias:
- Callsign:
- 1-3 true rumors about your character:
- 1-3 false rumors:
- 2-3 paragraph? backstory
  - (This doesn't have to be detailed or beefy. Just where you from and how did you end up at Mirrorsmoke. I've been reading the lore so I can help fill in details if you ask).

# Regarding Equipment
- You will each be provided weapons, gear and a GMS // Everest Unit upon deployment (Everest is the only mech license available to a level 0 pilot). We will go through this stuff and build level 0 Mechs together. If you wanna theory craft knock yourself out but don't lose sleep over technical stuff.
